# The Tevas Programming Language

Tevas, pronounced (Tev-AW-s), is a toy "programming language" built from scratch in Python Tevas's main goal is to be an exercise in demonstrating key programming concepts, such as control flow and variables. It's the first language I've ever written, and as such it's very simplistic and finicky.

Check out the [Tevas reference](doc/Tevas-reference.md) to see everything the language can do.

## Shell Usage
The Tevas Language includes a shell for executing Tevas code directly. Simply execute the script:
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py
```
You can run a Tevas source file by passing its path as an argument.
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py [path]
```
Tevas program files use the '.tev' extension.
