Tex is a general-purpose dynamically-typed toy language written in Python. Tex's main goal is to be my first language and an exercise. As such, it's very simplistic and finicky. All planned features haven't been implemented yet, see *TODO* for the list.

## REPL Usage
The Tex Language includes a shell for executing Tex code and programs. If you'd like to use the repl itself run:
```
~$ python3 repl.py
```
To run a program from a file, specify the location of the file using "--file":
```
~$ python3 repl.py --file [path]
```
Tex programs are files with the '.tx' extension.

## TODO
- Implementing context system
- Adding 'continue' and 'break' keywords
- Fix exception edge-cases.
- Add user-defined functions.
- Add built-in functions for math, and input.

## Contributing
I'm open to contributions, however the changes should be run on your local machine first. There are no tests to run, as I feel this project is not in a place to require them.

## Project Status
At this time, Tex is still in active development. I'm planning on continuing its development intermittently until February 2020 or so.
