# The Tex Programming Language

<img src="Tex_Logo.png" alt="Tex Logo" width="200"/>

Tex is a general-purpose dynamically-typed toy language written in Python. Tex's main goal is to be an exercise in demonstrating key programming concepts, such as control flow and variables. It's the first language I've ever written, and as such it's very simplistic and finicky.

To start programming in Tex, check out the [Tex Reference](doc/Tex-reference.md)

## Cloning
Clone repo
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/Tex-lang
~$ cd Tex-lang/src
```

## Use
The Tex Language includes a REPL for executing Tex code directly.
```
~$ python3 tex-repl.py
```
You can also run a Tex program in the form of a file. Specify the location of the file with "--file"
```
~$ python3 tex-repl.py --file [path]
```
You can save Tex programs as files with the '.tx' extension.
