# The Tevas Programming Language v2.0

`Tevas v2.0 is currently in development.`

Tevas, pronounced (Tev-AW-s), is a general-purpose dynamically-typed toy programming language built from scratch. Tevas's main goal is to be an exercise in demonstrating key programming concepts, such as control flow and variables. It's the first language I've ever written, and as such it's very simplistic and finicky.

To start programming in Tevas, check out the [Tevas Reference](doc/Tevas-reference.md)!

## Cloning
Clone repo
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/Tevas-lang
~$ cd Tevas-lang/src
```

## Usage
The Tevas Language includes a shell for executing Tevas code directly. Simply execute the script:
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py
```
You can run a Tevas source file by passing its path as an argument.
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py [path]
```
Tevas program files use the '.tev' extension.
