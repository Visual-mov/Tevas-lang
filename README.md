Tex is a general-purpose dynamically-typed toy language written in Python. Tex's main goal is to be my first language and an exercise. As such, it's very simplistic and finicky.

## REPL Usage
The Tex Language includes a shell for executing Tex code and programs. If you'd like to use the repl itself run:
```
~$ python3 repl.py
```
To run a program from a file, specify the location of the file using "--file":
```
~$ python3 repl.py --file [path]
```
Tex programs are files with the '.tx' extension.

## Contributing
I'm open to contributions, however the changes should be run on your local machine first. There are no tests to run, as I feel this project is not in a place to require them.

At this time, Tex is still in active development. I'm planning on continuing its development until 2020 or so.
