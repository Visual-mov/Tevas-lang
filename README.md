# The Tevas Programming Language v2.0

<!--<img src="Tevas_Logo.png" alt="Tevas Logo" width="200"/>-->

`Tevas v2.0 is currently in development.`

Tevas, pronounced (Tev-AW-s), is a general-purpose dynamically-typed toy language. Tevas's main goal is to be an exercise in demonstrating key programming concepts, such as control flow and variables. It's the first language I've ever written, and as such it's very simplistic and finicky.

To start programming in Tevas, check out the [Tevas Reference](doc/Tevas-reference.md)!

## Cloning
Clone repo
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/Tevas-lang
~$ cd Tevas-lang/src
```

## Usage
The Tevas Language includes a REPL for executing Tevas code directly. Simply execute the script:
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py
```
You can also run a Tevas program in the form of a file. Specify the location of the file with "--file"
```
~$ python3 tevas-repl.py --file [path]
```
Tevas program files use the '.tev' extension.
