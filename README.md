# The Tex Programming Language
Tex is a dynamically-typed functional language. Tex is currently in active development and as such, no documentation has been created yet. Heck this README is just a stand-in until I release the first version of this language.

## So what's it for?
Tex is the most amazing language that has graced this Earth in decades. *Sure...* In all seriousness, Tex is the first language that I've written. As such, it's a "toy" language. It wasn't created with any practical use in mind. However, I do plan to implement some functionality that will make it comparable to a scientific calculator in the future.
