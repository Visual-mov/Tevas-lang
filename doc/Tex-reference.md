# The Tex Programming Language Reference

## REPL
The Tex REPL takes in Tex code one line at a time. It will print the evaluated value of any expression entered into it. For example:
```
>> 2 + 2 = 4
true
>> (400 - 399)/2
0.5
>> "Hello" + " world!"
Hello world!
>>
```

## Syntax
Tex is a dynamically typed language. A variable's type does not need to be declared in assignment. All the type checking is done in runtime. Tex is not sensitive to indention (spaces and tabs), and line breaks. Line breaks are not tokenized, meaning Tex has no concept of them within the parser. This makes the syntax very "loose" feeling, meaning each one of these strings is a valid Tex program.

` 2 -> a 2 -> b println a * b`

```
           0 -> i 
       while[i 
             < 10]:
println i         i + 1 -> i
            end
```
Expressions and assignments can even be defined on multiple lines! Isn't that crazy!
```
false
||
true &&

true
->
myVar
```

## Comments
Comments are signified in Tex with the tilde character, '~'. All tokens after the tilde on the same line will be ignored.
```
~ This is my program!
println "Hello World"
```
Comments can also come after tokens on the same line.

`2 + 2 -> a  ~ Sets a equal to 4.`

## Variables
To declare a variable, use the store/assignment (->) operator. The expression on the left operand is the value to be stored, while the token on the right operand is the identifier. Identifiers can contain numbers, however they can't start with them.

```
2 * (2 + 2) -> a
(8.6 * 10.44) / 65 + 2 % 2.5 -> c
true -> d
```

### *Types*
Tex has 3 different types: Float, String, and Boolean. All type checking is done at runtime.

#### Float
Floats represent both floating-point numbers as well as integers in Tex.
```
5.5 + 2.9 -> myVar
23 - 4 -> myVar2
```

#### String
A String is a defined as being multiple between two double quotes. Strings can not span multiple lines.
```
"Foo" -> myString
"Lo!" -> myString2
```

Compound Strings can be formed by adding multiple Strings together, or combining Strings with Floats. If a String is combined Boolean, it will result in a type conflict however. Like every other expression, compound Strings are evaluated from left to right. This means the expression `2 + 2 + " = 4"` would be evaluated to `"4.0 = 4"`, as `2 + 2` is first evaluated as an arithmetical expression, and is then turned into a compound String when added to the string `" = 4"`

```
"Lo" + "gin" -> myString
100 + " many iterations!" -> myString2
(100 + 100) / 50 + " is equal to 4." -> myString3
```

#### Boolean
Booleans can have only one of two values, those being *true* or *false*. Only logical and comparison operations can be performed on booleans, which will evaluate to either *true* or *false*. In this case, myBool3 is equal to false.
```
true -> myBool
false -> myBool2
myBool = myBool2 -> myBool3
```

## Control Structures
### *Check*
The if/else control structure checks whether a given expression is true, and subsequently executes or skips the following block statement to execute the optional *else* block. Zero or more *celse* (check-else) blocks can follow a *check* block, which will be evaluated if the *check* block fails. This structure is implemented in the Tex language with the the keywords *check*, *celse*, and *else*. 
The given expression must evaluate to either true, or false. Expressions that evaluate to any other type are invalid.

```
check[expr]:
  ...statements
end
celse[expr]:
  ...statements
end
else:
  ...statements
end
```
```
check[a = b]:
  println "a is equal to b!"
end
celse[a > b]:
  println "a is larger than b!"
end
celse[a < b]:
  println "a is less than b!"
end
else:
  println "Hold on, a is not equal to b!"
end
```

### *While*
The while control structure continues to execute its block statement until the given expression evaluates to false. While is the only loop/repetition structure that exists in Tex.

```
while[expr]:
  ...statements
end
```
```
0 -> i
while[i < 10]:
  print i
  println " iterations"
  i + 1 -> i
end
```

*continue* and *break* statements allow you to control a loop's execution. The *break* keyword allows you to break out of the given loop, and continue execution. While the *continue* keyword returns the execution to the beginning of the loop, as well as re-evaluating the exit condition given.

#### Break
```
0 -> i
while[i < 5]:
  println i
  check[i = 3]: break end
  i + 1 -> i
end
```

```
Expected output:
0.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
```

#### Continue
```
0 -> i
while[i < 5]:
  println i
  check[i = 3]: continue end
  i + 1 -> i
end
```

```
Expected output:
0.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
3.0
3.0
3.0
...
```

## Other Statements
### *Print*
Prints a given Float, Boolean, or String using stdout.

```
"Hello World!" -> myString
print myString
```

`Output: Hello World!`


### *Println*
Same functionality as *print* statement, but appends a new-line character at the end of the given value.

```
"Hello World!" -> myString
print myString
```

`Output: Hello World!\n`

## Expressions
There exists three types of expressions in Tex, logical, arithmetical and compound Strings.

### *Binary Operators*
#### Logical Operators
```
= : Comparative equals (Is equal to)
!= : Comparative not equals (Is not equal to)
&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR

< : Less than.
> : Greater than.
<= : Less than or equal to.
>= : Greater than or equal to.
```
#### Arithmetical Operators
```
- : Subtract.
+ : Add. (Also used for compound Strings)
* : Multiply.
/ : Divide.
% : Modulo
```

### *Unary Operators*
```
- : Negative Float
+ : Positive Float
! : Logical NOT
```
